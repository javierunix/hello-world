# hello-world

My name is Javier. I'm biologist, but what a really like is Computer Science.  I'm very interested in Deep Learning. Currently
I am learning about Neural Networks and I am practicing with Tensorflow. I want to share with you all my little and modest achievements.
I love Open Source!!
